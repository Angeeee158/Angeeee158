## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
This is a great starting point for a vulnerability disclosure template! Here's a more detailed breakdown of each section and some additional considerations:

**Impact**

* **Vulnerability Type:** Be specific about the type of vulnerability. Examples include:
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites.
    * **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to manipulate database queries.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a system.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Prevents legitimate users from accessing a service.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** Allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Allows attackers to access sensitive information.
* **Affected Software:** Clearly state the software or product affected. Include the version(s) that are vulnerable.
* **Impact:** Describe the potential consequences of the vulnerability. This could include:
    * **Data breaches:** Sensitive information could be stolen.
    * **System compromise:** Attackers could gain control of the system.
    * **Service disruption:** The service could become unavailable.
    * **Financial loss:** Attackers could steal money or cause financial damage.
    * **Reputation damage:** The organization's reputation could be harmed.
* **Who is Impacted:**  Identify the specific groups or individuals who are at risk. This could include:
    * **Users:** Users of the affected software.
    * **Administrators:** Administrators of the affected systems.
    * **Organizations:** Organizations that use the affected software.

**Patches**

* **Availability:** State whether a patch is available. If so, provide the release date.
* **Versions:** Specify the versions of the software that are patched.
* **Installation Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how to install the patch.
* **Patching Timeline:** If a patch is not yet available, provide an estimated timeline for its release.

**Workarounds**

* **Mitigation Strategies:** List any temporary workarounds that users can implement to reduce their risk. This could include:
    * **Disabling certain features:** Disabling features that are vulnerable.
    * **Restricting access:** Restricting access to vulnerable systems or services.
    * **Using a firewall:** Using a firewall to block access to vulnerable ports.
    * **Updating security settings:** Updating security settings to mitigate the vulnerability.
* **Limitations:** Clearly state any limitations of the workarounds. For example, they may not be fully effective or may impact performance.

**References**

* **Official Documentation:** Link to any official documentation from the software vendor about the vulnerability.
* **Security Advisories:** Link to any security advisories or bulletins about the vulnerability.
* **External Resources:** Link to any relevant external resources, such as blog posts or security research papers.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Severity:** Assign a severity rating to the vulnerability. This helps users understand the level of risk.
* **Disclosure Timeline:** State when the vulnerability was discovered and when it was disclosed to the vendor.
* **Credit:** Acknowledge any individuals or organizations who helped discover or report the vulnerability.
* **Contact Information:** Provide contact information for users to report any issues or ask questions.

By following this template, you can create a clear and concise vulnerability disclosure that helps users understand the risks and take appropriate action.
